# Counterfactual Regret (CFR)

This repo is my implementation of the counterfactual regret algorithm outlined in this paper: https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~dturaev/neller-lanctot.pdf

This algorithm is applied to Kuhn Poker, a toy model game. In this game there is a deck of cards: 1, 2 and 3. There are two players who are dealt one card each at random.

Players ante one chip, and then the players take turns to bet. Each bet places an additional chip into the pot.

If a player bets and the other player chooses to pass, the betting player wins the pot. If both players bet or both pass, then the player with the higher card wins the pot.

## Running the algorithm

To run the algorithm and generate AI agent strategies simply enter ```python run_algorithm.py``` in your terminal in the root directory. The agent memories will be saved in the ```saved_data``` directory

## Playing against the AI

You can play against the strategies generated by the CFR algorithm by running ```python play_ai.py``` again in the root directory. The generated strategies are quite good, so be warned!
